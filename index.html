        <p>The purpose of this page is to show how we can turn a simple function into
           an arrow function. You should already know the basics of Javascript but I will
           briefly go over functions. Feel free to skip to the arrow functions segment.</p>

      <section class = "main-section" id = "What_is_a_Function?">
        <header>What is a Function?</header>
        <p>A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. It
           consists of the "function" keyword(declares the function). Followed by the name
           of the function. Followed by parameters. Followed by a statement. </p>
        <code>function add (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}</code>
        <p>The name of this function is "add". Parameters are "a" and "b". Parameters are
          enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. The statement is enclosed in
          curly brackets.   </p>
        <code>console.log(add(5, 6)); // logs 11;</code>
      </section>
      <section class = "main-section" id = "What_is_an_Arrow_Function?">
        <header>What is an Arrow Function?</header>
        <p>An arrow function is a new way to write a function introduced in ES6. Its called an
           arrow function due to the syntax looking like a fat arrow =>.</p>
          <code>var add = (a, b) => a + b <br/>
console.log(add(2,3)) // equals 5</code>
      </section>
      <section class = "main-section" id = "When_Should_I_Use_Them?">
    <header>When Should I Use Them?</header>
        <p>Arrow functions work really well with higher order functions such as map(), filter()
           , or reduce(). You should use arrow functions whenever they make your code look more readable, without breaking the functionality. </p>
          <p>Instead of:</p>
           <code>var example = [1, 2, 3]

example.map(function(number) {
  return number * 2} // returns [2, 4, 6]
})</code>
         <p>
           You can write:
         </p>
             <code>example.map((number) => number * 2)</code>
          <p>As you can see arrow functions just remove the need to declare using "function"
            key word. And no need to use the "return" key word either. Also I don't even need
            to enclose my statement in curly brackets. if for some reason you do need to
            enclose in curly brackets,such as in an "if" statement, then the "return" word
            is necessary.</p>
      </section>
      <section class = "main-section" id = "When_Should_I_Not_Use_Them?">
        <header>When Should I Not Use Them?</header>
          <p>Arrow functions change the scope of the "this" keyword. Instead of referencing
            the scope in which it was defined, it lexically goes up a scope. Inheriting the
            value of "this" from it's parent scope.(If you are not familiar with the "this"
            key word or lexical scope, don't worry. You will learn these terms when you
            advance a little more.)</p>
          <p>What does that mean? Simply you don't want to use arrow functions when you need
            the "this" keyword to be bound to the scope in which is was called. Such as in
            an object method. Also you don't want to use them when they make your code less
            readable.</p>

        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul class = "prosCons">
          <li>Arrow syntax automatically binds "this" to the parent scope.</li>
          <li>The syntax allows an implicit return when there is no body
            block(enclosing curly braces), resulting in cleaner and usually
            simpler code.</li>
          <li>Work very well with higher order functions. Such as map, filter, and reduce.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul class = "prosCons">
          <li>Not good for object methods</li>
          <li>Since they are anonymous. They are harder to debug.</li>
          <li>They don't work well with functions that have dynamic context.
            Since the "this" keyword is bound to the parent scope.</li>
         </ul>
      <p>Arrow functions are a nice way to clean up your code. Using neat code allows others
        to quickly understand and modify your code. You don't want to use arrow functions
        when they make your code less readable. Or when they interfere with a certain
        functionality of your code. </p>
